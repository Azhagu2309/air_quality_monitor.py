# Smart Air Quality Monitoring System
A software-based system that analyzes air quality data to detect unsafe pollution levels and provide early alerts through data visualization.

## Problem Statement
Air pollution levels fluctuate throughout the day, but most people lack access to real-time insights. Dependence on costly sensor-based systems prevents early awareness of unsafe air conditions, increasing health risks.

## Solution
This project is a software-based system that analyzes air quality data to detect unsafe pollution levels, visualize trends, and alert users when air quality crosses safe limits.

## Tech Stack
Python  
Pandas  
Matplotlib  

## How It Works
- Reads air quality index data
- Defines a safety threshold
- Detects unsafe air conditions
- Displays alerts and a visualization graph

## How to Run
pip install pandas matplotlib  
python air_quality_monitor.py  

## Use Case
- Smart cities
- Public health monitoring
- Environmental awareness
- Early pollution alerts
